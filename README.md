# FPGA-based-Image-Recognition
In this Project, our main aim is to accelerate the image recognition of CNN (Convolution Neural Network) with the help of a platform deployable on FPGA. CNN focuses on image classification, speech recognition, and video analysis. CNN is accelerated by using GPU (Graphical Processing Unit), which is relatively slow and consumes a high amount of power as CNN requires 20 GFLOPS/image. Also, the CPU acceleration being cheaper as it is readily available on most x86 machines is proportional to power. The modern Application-Specific Chips(ASICS) and the capability of a Field Programmable Gate Array( FPGA ) have power efficiency and faster computation rate over the GPU. With FPGA as a reconfigurable base and parallel architecture, we decided to target the CNN acceleration with an FPGA using Pipe CNN- an algorithm that gets synthesized via HLS (Hardware Level Synthesis Tools) like Intel's Quartus, and Open CL toolkit. Modern Large scale FPGA's like Stratix 10 and Arria 10 have shown a 10 percent less power consumption than GPU's, and it has an added advantage of pipeline parallel architecture and dedicated DSP for faster and efficient computations. The main goal of the Project is to design an OpenCL accelerator that is generic and yet powerful means of improving throughput in inference computations
